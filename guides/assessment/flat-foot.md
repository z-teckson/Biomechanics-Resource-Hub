# Flat Foot Assessment Guide

## Introduction

Flat foot, or pes planus, is a common condition characterized by the collapse of the medial longitudinal arch. This guide outlines the clinical assessment of flat foot deformity in patients.

## Adult Assessment

### Subjective Evaluation
- Patient history of pain, fatigue, or previous injuries
- Occupation and activity level
- Footwear habits

### Objective Evaluation
- **Visual Inspection**: Observe arch height, heel alignment, and forefoot abduction in standing.
- **Palpation**: Check for tenderness along the posterior tibial tendon, spring ligament, and sinus tarsi.
- **Range of Motion**: Assess ankle dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, subtalar joint inversion/eversion.
- **Functional Tests**:
  - Single-leg heel rise test
  - Too-many-toes sign
  - Navicular drop test
- **Gait Analysis**: Observe for excessive pronation, abducted foot progression angle.

### Imaging
- Weight-bearing X-rays: AP, lateral, and axial views to assess alignment and joint degeneration.
- MRI if tendon or ligament pathology is suspected.

## Management
- Orthotic intervention
- Physical therapy
- Surgical referral for severe, symptomatic cases.
